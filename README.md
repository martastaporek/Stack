# Stack

    it should be generic
    the size should be given in the constructor (no default constructor allowed)
    push functionality (when I add an item to the stack)
    pop functionality (when I remove an item)
    peek functionality (I can receive the top item without removing it from the stack, so it's peeking)
    I want to be able to get the size of the stack (I mean the maximum capacity)
    And write me a method which gives back the number of free spaces left
    throw an exception when the stack is full and I want to add one more item
    throw an exception when the stack is empty and I want to pop an item
    Unit tests!!
